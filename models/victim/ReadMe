Note on Missing Checkpoint Files
The files model.safetensors and optimizer.pt inside checkpoint2694/ directory are not included in this repository because their sizes exceed GitHub’s upload limits.
Similarly, the model.safetensors file in victim directory is also too large to be uploaded.
However, the victim model can be fully retrained and reproduced using the script: cema/04_select_evaluate.py
This script will automatically train and generate the required checkpoints, though the training process may take a considerable amount of time depending on your hardware.
