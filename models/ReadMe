## Substitute Models (substitute/) ##
These models are trained to approximate the black-box behavior of the victim classifier.

Training process:
- Extract sentence embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Generate pseudo-labels using KMeans clustering
- Train several small Chinese RoBERTa models, each with different sampling and initialization
- Store all models to build an ensemble

Each sub_x directory contains all necessary files for one substitute model, and a total of 8 such models are included in the ensemble.
---

## Victim Model (victim/)
This directory stores the final classifier being attacked.

In this reproduction:
- **Chinese Longformer 110M** (fine-tuned) is used as the victim model.

`04_select_and_evaluate.py` loads this model to compute:
- Clean accuracy  
- Adversarial accuracy  
- Attack Success Rate (ASR)
