Note on Missing Checkpoint Files
The files model.safetensors and optimizer.pt inside each sub_x (x = 0–7) checkpoint1314/ directory are not included in this repository because their sizes exceed GitHub’s upload limits.
Similarly, the model.safetensors file in each sub_x directory is also too large to be uploaded.
However, all eight substitute models can be fully retrained and reproduced using the script: cema/04_select_evaluate.py
This script will automatically train and generate the required checkpoints, though the training process may take a considerable amount of time depending on your hardware.
