CEMA Reproduction for Chinese Fraud Dialogue Detection

This repository reproduces the Counterfactual Ensemble Model Attack (CEMA) framework described in:
“Multi-task Adversarial Attacks against Black-box Model with Few-shot Queries” ( https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.684/ )
The reproduction is adapted and extended for Chinese fraud dialogue classification, with enhancements in data processing, candidate generation, and ensemble modeling.

Key Contributions of This Reproduction
1. Full adaptation of CEMA to Chinese fraud dialogue detection  
   Including preprocessing, data augmentation, and Chinese model training.

2. Enhanced auxiliary data construction  
   Noise words (e.g., “maybe”, “probably”) and punctuation variations are added to improve substitute model robustness.

3. Improved substitute model ensemble  
   - Chinese RoBERTa-small models  
   - Different random seeds + sampling  
   - Embedding-based pseudo-labels from MiniLM + KMeans

4. Richer adversarial candidate generation  
   Extends the original Hotflip + paraphrasing + logic attacks with:
   - MaskedLM token substitutions  
   - Speculative / hedging logical prefixes  
   - High-temperature T5 paraphrases  
   - Semantic filtering using SBERT  

5. Weighted scoring mechanism for better selection 
   `score = 0.6 * ensemble_diff + 0.4 * semantic_similarity`  
   Balances attack strength and semantic fidelity.

6. Victim classifier replaced with a fine-tuned Chinese Longformer (110M)  
   A realistic setting for fraud dialogue detection tasks.
