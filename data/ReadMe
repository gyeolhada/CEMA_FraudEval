trainResult.csv (Fraud-dialogue dataset provided by the instructor)
Contains the processed training data with model predictions/confidences.  
Used for:
- Building the auxiliary set (`01_build_auxiliary.py`)
- Training substitute models and preparing the victim model (`02_train_substitute.py`, `04_select_and_evaluate.py`)

testResult.csv (Fraud-dialogue dataset provided by the instructor)  
Used only for evaluation.  
Also serves as the source for:
- Generating adversarial candidates in `03_generate_candidates.py`
- Evaluating victim model performance on original vs. adversarial texts in `04_select_and_evaluate.py`

auxiliary/
Generated by `01_build_auxiliary.py`.  
Contains cleaned pseudo-unlabeled samples (e.g., `aux_texts.csv`) used for training the substitute models.
